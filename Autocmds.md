## 📞 Autocmds

`markview.nvim` emits various *autocmd events* during different parts of the rendering allowing users to extend the plugin's functionality.

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
    pattern = "MarkviewAttach",
    callback = function (event)
        --- This will have all the data you need.
        local data = event.data;

        vim.print(data);
    end
})
```
